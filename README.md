__Responsible ML (Azure)__

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/responsibleml/#overview

_TO EXPAND!_

__Sagemaker pipelines (Amazon)__

https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/pipelines/

* purpose-built, easy-to-use continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) service for machine learning. Workflows can be shared and re-used between teams. Create, automate, and manage end-to-end ML workflows at scale.
* Automate different steps of the ML workflow, including data loading, data transformation, training and tuning, and deployment. With SageMaker Pipelines, you can build dozens of ML models a week, manage massive volumes of data, thousands of training experiments, and hundreds of different model versions. You can share and re-use workflows to recreate or optimize models, helping you scale ML throughout your organization.
* Create an audit trail of model components such as training data, platform configurations, model parameters, and learning gradients. Audit trails can be used to recreate models and help support compliance requirements.

__Mlflow__

https://mlflow.org/

MLflow is an open source platform for managing the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle. It tackles four primary functions:
* Tracking experiments to record and compare parameters and results (MLflow Tracking). The MLflow Tracking component is an API and UI for logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files when running your machine learning code and for later visualizing the results. MLflow Tracking lets you log and query experiments using Python, REST, R API, and Java API APIs.
* Packaging ML code in a reusable, reproducible form in order to share with other data scientists or transfer to production (MLflow Projects). An MLflow Project is a format for packaging data science code in a reusable and reproducible way, based primarily on conventions. In addition, the Projects component includes an API and command-line tools for running projects, making it possible to chain together projects into workflows. 
* Managing and deploying models from a variety of ML libraries to a variety of model serving and inference platforms (MLflow Models). An MLflow Model is a standard format for packaging machine learning models that can be used in a variety of downstream tools—for example, real-time serving through a REST API or batch inference on Apache Spark. The format defines a convention that lets you save a model in different “flavors” that can be understood by different downstream tools.
* Providing a central model store to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model, including model versioning, stage transitions, and annotations (MLflow Model Registry).  The MLflow Model Registry component is a centralized model store, set of APIs, and UI, to collaboratively manage the full lifecycle of an MLflow Model. It provides model lineage (which MLflow experiment and run produced the model), model versioning, stage transitions (for example from staging to production), and annotations.

MLflow is library-agnostic. You can use it with any machine learning library, and in any programming language, since all functions are accessible through a REST API and CLI. For convenience, the project also includes a Python API, R API, and Java API.

__TensorBoard__

https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard 

TensorBoard: TensorFlow's visualization toolkit. TensorBoard provides the visualization and tooling needed for machine learning experimentation:
* Tracking and visualizing metrics such as loss and accuracy
* Visualizing the model graph (ops and layers)
* Viewing histograms of weights, biases, or other tensors as they change over time
* Projecting embeddings to a lower dimensional space
* Displaying images, text, and audio data
* Profiling TensorFlow programs

__Adversarial robustness toolbox (IBM)__

https://adversarial-robustness-toolbox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

https://github.com/Trusted-AI/adversarial-robustness-toolbox

Adversarial Robustness Toolbox (ART) is a Python library for Machine Learning Security. ART provides tools that enable developers and researchers to defend and evaluate Machine Learning models and applications against the adversarial threats of Evasion, Poisoning, Extraction, and Inference. ART supports all popular machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, MXNet, scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, GPy, etc.), all data types (images, tables, audio, video, etc.) and machine learning tasks (classification, object detection, speech recognition, generation, certification, etc.).
 
__Neptune.AI__

https://neptune.ai/product

Metadata store for MLOps, built for research and production teams that run a lot of experiments. ML metadata store is an essential part of the MLOps stack that deals with model building metadata management. It makes it easy to log, store, display, organize, compare and query all metadata generated during ML model lifecycle. 
Experiment and model training metadata. You can log anything that happens during ML run.
Artifact metadata. For datasets, predictions or models you can log things like paths to dataset, dataset hash, feature column names, who created / modified + timestamps
Model metadata. For trained models (production or not) you can log things such as model binary or location to model asset, dataset version, links to recorded model training runs and experiments, model descriptions and so on.
You can use the metadata store to track your experiments, register your models, and more.

__Sacred__

https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred

Sacred is a tool to help you configure, organize, log and reproduce experiments. It is designed to do all the tedious overhead work that you need to do around your actual experiment in order to:
1.	keep track of all the parameters of your experiment
2.	easily run your experiment for different settings
3.	save configurations for individual runs in a database
4.	reproduce your results
Sacred achieves this through the following main mechanisms:
1.	ConfigScopes A very convenient way of the local variables in a function to define the parameters your experiment uses.
2.	Config Injection: You can access all parameters of your configuration from every function. They are automatically injected by name.
3.	Command-line interface: You get a powerful command-line interface for each experiment that you can use to change parameters and run different variants.
4.	Observers: Sacred provides Observers that log all kinds of information about your experiment, its dependencies, the configuration you used, the machine it is run on, and of course the result. These can be saved to a MongoDB, for easy access later.
5.	Automatic seeding helps controlling the randomness in your experiments, such that the results remain reproducible.

__Crypten (Facebook)__

https://github.com/facebookresearch/CrypTen 

CrypTen is a framework for Privacy Preserving Machine Learning built on PyTorch. Its goal is to make secure computing techniques accessible to Machine Learning practitioners. It currently implements Secure Multiparty Computation as its secure computing backend and offers three main benefits to ML researchers:
1.	It is machine learning first. The framework presents the protocols via a CrypTensor object that looks and feels exactly like a PyTorch Tensor. This allows the user to use automatic differentiation and neural network modules akin to those in PyTorch.
2.	CrypTen is library-based. It implements a tensor library just as PyTorch does. This makes it easier for practitioners to debug, experiment on, and explore ML models.
3.	The framework is built with real-world challenges in mind. CrypTen does not scale back or oversimplify the implementation of the secure protocols.

__PySyft__

https://www.openmined.org/ 

OpenMined is an open-source community whose goal is to make the world more privacy-preserving by lowering the barrier-to-entry to private AI technologies.
https://github.com/OpenMined/PySyft 

Syft decouples private data from model training, using Federated Learning, Differential Privacy, and Encrypted Computation (like Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Homomorphic Encryption (HE)) within the main Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.
Most software libraries let you compute over the information you own and see inside of machines you control. However, this means that you cannot compute on information without first obtaining (at least partial) ownership of that information. It also means that you cannot compute using machines without first obtaining control over those machines. This is very limiting to human collaboration and systematically drives the centralization of data, because you cannot work with a bunch of data without first putting it all in one (central) place.

The Syft ecosystem seeks to change this system, allowing you to write software which can compute over information you do not own on machines you do not have (total) control over. This not only includes servers in the cloud, but also personal desktops, laptops, mobile phones, websites, and edge devices. Wherever your data wants to live in your ownership, the Syft ecosystem exists to help keep it there while allowing it to be used privately for computation.
* Federated learning: a type of remote execution wherein models are sent to remote data-holding machines (such as smart phones or IoT devices) for local training. This eliminates the need to store sensitive training data on a central server.
* On-device prediction:  a special case of remote execution wherein models are used within an application locally instead of moving a dataset to the cloud for classification.
* Multi-party computation: When a model has multiple owners, multi-party computation allows for individuals to share control of a model without seeing its contents such that no sole owner can use or train it.
* Homomorphic encryption: When a model has a single owner, homomorphic encryption allows an owner to encrypt their model so that untrusted 3rd parties can train or use the model without being able to steal it.
* Differential Privacy: ventually you must request the results of your remote (or encrypted) analysis to be revealed (i.e., statistical results, a trained model, prediction, or synthetic dataset). Differential Privacy helps us answer the question, “If I were to reveal this datapoint, what’s the maximum amount of private information I may leak?” and obfuscate the data appropriately. We extend PyTorch and Tensorflow with the ability to perform differential privacy automatically.

__What if tool (Google People and AI Research)__

https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/

https://github.com/pair-code/what-if-tool

Visually probe the behavior of trained machine learning models, with minimal coding.
A key challenge in developing and deploying responsible Machine Learning (ML) systems is understanding their performance across a wide range of inputs.
Using WIT, you can test performance in hypothetical situations, analyze the importance of different data features, and visualize model behavior across multiple models and subsets of input data, and for different ML fairness metrics.
The What-If Tool can work with any python-accessible model in Notebook environments, and will work with most models hosted by TF-serving in Tensorboard.
The What-If Tool supports:
* binary classification*
* multi-class classification
* regression tasks
Fairness optimization strategies are available only with binary classification models due to the nature of the strategies themselves.
In the What-If Tool, Counterfactuals are datapoints that are most similar to a selected datapoint, but are classified differently by a model.
For binary classification models, counterfactuals are the most similar datapoint to a selected datapoint that is predicted in the opposite class or label by a model.
For regression models, counterfactuals are calculated when the difference in prediction score between the selected datapoint and a candidate counterfactual is equal or greater to the “counterfactual threshold”. The counterfactual threshold default is set to the standard deviation of the prediction values and can be adjusted by the user.
For multi-class models, the counterfactual is the most similar datapoint to a selected datapoint, but is classified as any class other than the selected datapoint’s class.

__Tensorwatch__

https://github.com/microsoft/tensorwatch

TensorWatch is a debugging and visualization tool designed for data science, deep learning and reinforcement learning from Microsoft Research. It works in Jupyter Notebook to show real-time visualizations of your machine learning training and perform several other key analysis tasks for your models and data.
TensorWatch is designed to be flexible and extensible so you can also build your own custom visualizations, UIs, and dashboards. Besides traditional "what-you-see-is-what-you-log" approach, it also has a unique capability to execute arbitrary queries against your live ML training process, return a stream as a result of the query and view this stream using your choice of a visualizer (we call this Lazy Logging Mode).
When you write to a TensorWatch stream, the values get serialized and sent to a TCP/IP socket as well as the file you specified. From Jupyter Notebook, we load the previously logged values from the file and then listen to that TCP/IP socket for any future values. The visualizer listens to the stream and renders the values as they arrive.
Ok, so that's a very simplified description. The TensorWatch architecture is actually much more powerful. Almost everything in TensorWatch is a stream. Files, sockets, consoles and even visualizers are streams themselves. A cool thing about TensorWatch streams is that they can listen to any other streams. This allows TensorWatch to create a data flow graph. This means that a visualizer can listen to many streams simultaneously, each of which could be a file, a socket or some other stream. You can recursively extend this to build arbitrary data flow graphs. TensorWatch decouples streams from how they get stored and how they get visualized.

__Rulex__

https://www.rulex.ai/rulex-explainable-ai-xai/

Explainable AI produces transparent, easily understandable models. Using a series of if-then statements, Rulex automatically produces self-explanatory logic for all decisions. Rulex rulesets make it possible to explain a decision directly to the customer or provide customer service agents with the ability to look up the reason for a decision.
Why eXplainable AI is more transparent than black box?
The problem with conventional AI is very simple: it’s unexplainable. Conventional AI relies on machine learning algorithms such as neural networks and others that have one key feature in common: they produce “black box” predictive models, meaning they’re mathematical functions that cannot be understood by people, even mathematicians.
Rulex’s core machine learning algorithm, the Logic Learning Machine (LLM), works in an entirely different way from conventional AI. Rather than producing a math function, it produces conditional logic rules that predict the best decision choice, in plain language that is immediately clear to process professionals. Rulex rules make every prediction fully self-explanatory.
And unlike decision trees and other algorithms that produce rules, Rulex rules are stateless and overlapping, meaning one rule can cover many cases, and many rules can cover a single case. This allows for fewer, simpler rules and provides broader coverage at the same time.
Rulex calculates the coverage and accuracy of each rule, making it easy to select the most effective decision rules. Also, proven heuristic human rules can be added to the predictive model, allowing a seamless blend of human and artificial intelligence. Human rules are also rated for coverage and accuracy, allowing Rulex to easily evaluate the quality of the decision rules in use and reduce false positives.

__Contrastive explanations__

https://pythonrepo.com/repo/MarcelRobeer-ContrastiveExplanation-python-deep-learning-model-explanation 

Contrastive Explanation provides an explanation for why an instance had the current outcome (fact) rather than a targeted outcome of interest (foil). These counterfactual explanations limit the explanation to the features relevant in distinguishing fact from foil, thereby disregarding irrelevant features. The idea of contrastive explanations is captured in this Python package ContrastiveExplanation. Example facts and foils are:
Machine Learning (ML) type	Problem	Explainable AI (XAI) question	Fact	Foil
Classification	Determine type of animal	Why is this instance a cat rather than a dog?	Cat	Dog
Regression analysis	Predict students' grade	Why is the predicted grade for this student 6.5 rather than higher?	6.5	More than 6.5
Clustering	Find similar flowers	Why is this flower in cluster 1 rather than cluster 4?	Cluster 1	Cluster 4

__Explainerdashboard__

https://github.com/oegedijk/explainerdashboard 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nMlfrDvwc8

This package makes it convenient to quickly deploy a dashboard web app that explains the workings of a (scikit-learn compatible) machine learning model. The dashboard provides interactive plots on model performance, feature importances, feature contributions to individual predictions, "what if" analysis, partial dependence plots, SHAP (interaction) values, visualisation of individual decision trees, etc.
You can also interactively explore components of the dashboard in a notebook/colab environment (or just launch a dashboard straight from there). Or design a dashboard with your own custom layout and explanations (thanks to the modular design of the library). And you can combine multiple dashboards into a single ExplainerHub.
Dashboards can be exported to static html directly from a running dashboard, or programmatically as an artifact as part of an automated CI/CD deployment process.

* A Python library for fairness assessment and improvement (fairness metrics, mitigation algorithms, plotting, etc.)
The Fairlearn tookit can assist in assessing and mitigation unfairness in Machine Learning models. It’s impossible to provide a sufficient overview of fairness in ML in this Quickstart tutorial, so we highly recommend starting with our User Guide. Fairness is a fundamentally sociotechnical challenge and cannot be solved with technical tools alone. They may be helpful for certain tasks such as assessing unfairness through various metrics, or to mitigate observed unfairness when training a model. Additionally, fairness has different definitions in different contexts and it may not be possible to represent it quantitatively at all.
* Metrics for assessing which groups are negatively impacted by a model, and for comparing multiple models in terms of various fairness and accuracy metrics.
* Algorithms for mitigating unfairness in a variety of AI tasks and along a variety of fairness definitions.

__Sagemaker clarify (Amazon)__

https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/clarify/

Provides machine learning developers with greater visibility into their training data and models so they can identify and limit bias and explain predictions.
Biases are imbalances in the training data or prediction behavior of the model across different groups, such as age or income bracket. Biases can result from the data or algorithm used to train your model. For instance, if an ML model is trained primarily on data from middle-aged individuals, it may be less accurate when making predictions involving younger and older people. The field of machine learning provides an opportunity to address biases by detecting them and measuring them in your data and model. You can also look at the importance of model inputs to explain why models make the predictions they do.
Amazon SageMaker Clarify detects potential bias during data preparation, after model training, and in your deployed model by examining attributes you specify. For instance, you can check for bias related to age in your initial dataset or in your trained model and receive a detailed report that quantifies different types of possible bias. SageMaker Clarify also includes feature importance graphs that help you explain model predictions and produces reports which can be used to support internal presentations or to identify issues with your model that you can take steps to correct.
* Identify imbalances in data
* Check trained models for bias
* Monitor model for bias
* Understand model
* Monitor model for changes in behavior
* explain individual model predictions

__ML Fairness gym (Google)__

https://github.com/google/ml-fairness-gym

ML-fairness-gym is a set of components for building simple simulations that explore the potential long-run impacts of deploying machine learning-based decision systems in social environments. As the importance of machine learning fairness has become increasingly apparent, recent research has focused on potentially surprising long term behaviors of enforcing measures of fairness that were originally defined in a static setting. Key findings have shown that under specific assumptions in simplified dynamic simulations, long term effects may in fact counteract the desired goals. Achieving a deeper understanding of such long term effects is thus a critical direction for ML fairness research. ML-fairness-gym implements a generalized framework for studying and probing long term fairness effects in carefully constructed simulation scenarios where a learning agent interacts with an environment over time. This work fits into a larger push in the fair machine learning literature to design decision systems that induce fair outcomes in the long run, and to understand how these systems might differ from those designed to enforce fairness on a one-shot basis.

Using fairness-gym in your research

ML-fairness-gym brings reinforcement learning-style evaluations to fairness in machine learning research. Here is a suggested pattern for using the ML-fairness-gym as part of the research process. Others may be added here as we continue to grow.

Evaluating a proposed ML algorithm

Here are suggested steps when evaluating a proposed new fair ML algorthm:
* Choose a simulation environment.
* Decide on metrics that you would like to measure for that environment.
* Choose baseline agents and choose what reward functions they will optimize.
* Write an agent that uses your new algorithm.
* Compare metrics between your baseline agents and your fair agent. Some utilities for building experiments are provided in run_util.py. For example, run_simulationis a simple function that runs an experiment and returns metric measurements.
* Explore parameter settings in your simulation environment - are there different regimes?

We provide some implementations of environments, agents, and metrics, but they are by no means comprehensive. Feel free to implement your own and contribute to ML-fairness-gym!

__Aequitas__

https://dssg.github.io/aequitas/

Aequitas is an open-source bias audit toolkit for data scientists, machine learning researchers, and policymakers to audit machine learning models for discrimination and bias, and to make informed and equitable decisions around developing and deploying predictive tools.
